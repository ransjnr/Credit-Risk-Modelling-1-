DATA
Data is a key component in machine learning and provides the foundation for machine learning algorithms. Machiens require vast amounts of data to learn from to function and make informed decisions. Any unprocessed information, value, sound, image, or text can be considered data. The accuracy and effectiveness of a machine learning model heavily depend on the quality and quantity of data used for its training.

While creating a data set, ensure that it has the 5V characteristids:

Volume: The amount of information required for the model to be accurate and effective matters. The accuracy of the machine learning model will increase with the size of the data collected.

Velocity: The speed of data generation and processing is also crucial. Real-time data propcessing may be required in some cases to get accurate results.

Variety: The data set should include variety in form, for instance, structed, unstrucuted, and semi-structured data.

Veracity: Data cleanliness, consistency, and error-free are all qualitites and accuracy aspects of data. Only with accurate data a precise output can be expected.

Value: The information in the data must be valuable to draw any conclusion.
