MODEL
The model slerves as the underlying core component of machine learning and represents the link between input and output to generate precise and fresh data. It is trained on a dataset to identify underlying patterns and produce accurate results. Following training, the model is tested to determin if it can provide fresh and precise data; if the test is succesful, it is then used for real-world applciations.

ALGORITHM
A model is trained uusing an algorithm that can learn the hidden patterns from the data, predict the output, and improve the performance from experiences. It is an essential part of machine learning since it powers the learning process and affects the precision and potency of the model.

A training dataset consists of input data and associated output values. Once patterns and association have been identified in the data, several mathematical and statistical techniques are used to determine the underlying relationship between the input and output.

MACHINE LEARNING METHODS

Supervised Learning:
Subset of machine learning that trains its algorithm using labeled datasets. Labeled data are those that have output tagged along with the input.

Types of supervise learning are:
(1)Classification
(2)Regression

Unsupervised learning: involves using unlabeled data for machine learning.

Semi-supervised learning refers to machine laerning that falls between supervised and unspervised learning. It is a training method that blends a significant amount of unlabeled data with a small amount of labeled data.

Reinforcement leaning is a type of machine learning that involves an autonomous agent learning to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize reward signal. RL aims to find the optimal policy, which is a set of rules that tells the agent which action to take in a given state to maximize its long-term reward. The agen learns this policy through trial and error by taking actions, observing the resulting state and reward, and updating its decision-making strategy accrodingly.

Deep learning:
Are created to learn and develop over time through ha process known as backpropagation.
